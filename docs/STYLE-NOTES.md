Thoughts on colours:
 - Rufous seems to go with all the best, so maybe a good header/footer colour
 - Home page should probably be the vanilla colour but with all colours featured!
 - Nav links might be worth having a hover effect?
 - Do I want to 'complete' the navbar first? 

 The orange on the black looks *really good*. For the code snippets maybe? 

 Could experiment with a palette like this (adds a pink and another blue) for dark cyan.
