Selectors
Pseudo-Selectors
Pseudo-Classes
 - :hover is the most useful
 - first-child or nth-child
 - :not(selector) seems useful/not sure why not used more!
 - :empty also might be useful (and easy to demonstrate)
Pseudo-Elements
 - ::first-line (fun to demonstrate responsively!) 
 - ::first-letter
 - ::marker (not sure if better way to do this)
 - ::selection
