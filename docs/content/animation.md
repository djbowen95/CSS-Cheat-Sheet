(these are covered by firebase)

2D/3D (w schools)

2D:
 - translate (move)
 - rotate
 - scale (make bigger / smaller), (x/y/neither)
 - skew (x/y or both)
 - matrix (do a combination of the above)

3D:
 - rotate x
 - rotate y
 - rotate z
 - backface-visibility
 - maybe perspective? transform-style?

 - z-index? not sure if i want to cover on this page but could be fun to play with in animation?
  - z-index would be cool with my connect four idea!
