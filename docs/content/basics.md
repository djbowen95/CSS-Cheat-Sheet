Colors (foreground, background, gradient)
Display (inline, block, none)
Box model (padding, margin, border)
Position (relative, absolute, fixed)

Fancy boxes: rounded boxes, shadow

What's next:
Responsive design (media queries, flexbox, grid)
Selectors - Typography - Animation

Might also want to cover border images, masking (seems useful!)
